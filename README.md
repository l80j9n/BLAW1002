BLAW1002 S2 2024 – EPA Brief 
A. Context and Overview
‘Assessment 2’   is   the Economics Principles   Analysis (EPA),   worth 30% of   the   final mark.   The EPA is a ‘take-home’   activity, consisting of a set of tasks to do.
This EPA assesses the Economics   Topics E1 (Module 6) and E2 (Module 7).   You   will have up   to eighteen (18) days to complete   the EPA on   your own.
Timeline of EPA-specific events (local time in   year 2024AD):
1.       Assessment brief available on Blackboard (Bb): 9th September, 9pm.
2. Submit to Turnitin by the official due date: 27th September, 11:59pm.
3.       ETA of marks/feedback on   your EPA in Grade Centre is by 18th October, 9pm.
Key assessment information:
EPA consists of three compulsory questions: Q1 - 10 marks; Q2 - 15 marks; Q3 - 5 marks.
For supporting info on EPA, refer to   following PDFs,   available in   Assessments   tab on Bb:
1) EPA Brief S2 2024 [this document]
2) Marking Guidance and FAQs for EPA S2 2024 
Your answers need to be   typed, but diagrams must be hand-drawn (digital inking using a   stylus is   fine) and included in the   Word document or in PDF.
Main   thing is   that   you specifically answer the tasks and have sufficient explanations, and   refer   to key sentences and ideas   from   various articles*   where relevant   to support   your analysis. *=   the key articles are available   for   free online - but if not most   from Curtin’s   Library databases (but see doc. 2). Note,   the   word count is a suggested maximum. 
The EPA   will take up some of   your   thinking   time, but   this is a doable assessment.
A general guide on   what the marker is looking   for in   this assessment is recalling   the   tutor- student discussions in   the M6, M7 and M8   workshop sessions.   Your   tutor as an exemplar would have gone   through   the process of how best to explain price elasticity of demand and   the   key isoprofit diagram,   and so on.   The lectures on E1 and E2 (especially the Module 7   topic) may   come in handy as   well. 
You are   to complete   the   two parts of this EPA by   your human self -- no need   for   you   to share/upload it on   the   web for extra help -- please no Gen-AI LLMs or other agent assistance. The lectures, set   tutorial questions, and assigned readings   within   this brief and from   the CORE   text should be sufficient resources   for   you   to draw upon   to do   the   tasks   well enough. Many thanks in advance   for   your cooperation, Brennan   AI   Tech Incorporated (BAT Inc.) IMPORTANT: When   ready   to   submit, ONLY include answers and prepare your document as following: Full Name and Student ID on   the   first page as a   title in   the   Word document (or PDF)   to   Turnitin by the due date (see Assessmentstab on Bb).B. Assessment Tasks
Q1 – 10 Marks 
Consider   these   two   scenarios   for   Nike   shoes   and   how   the price elasticity affects   its revenue:
Scenario 1: Assume Nike increased the price of Air Jordans for sneaker aficionados by 20% in first half of 
2023. Explain the elasticity of demand based on the (freely-available) articles below:

Scenario 2: Assume Nike increased the price of Air Force 1 shoes by 10% in first half of 2024. Explain the elasticity of demand based on the (freely-available) article below:

For   each   scenario, do   the   following:
a.            Draw   a   single   straight-line   demand   curve   and   explain   the   relevant   details   on   the   price   elasticity   of demand (PED).
b.         Show   the   workings   of   your   calculation   of   PED.
c.            Describe   and   quantify   what   would   happen   to   revenue   in   this   case.
d.         In   your   answer, use   hypothetical   incremental   values   (rough   guesses   from   your   imagination)   for   the prices   on   the   y-axis   and   quantities   on   the   x-axis.

Q2 – 15 Marks 
Adidas   has   gained   brand   momentum   and   outperformed   Nike   in   the   first   half   of   2024. Consider   Addidas’   classic   shoes, Sambas   which   are   back   in   vogue   (for   now).
https://www.fastcompany.com/91118038/sneaker-sales-sambas-2023-shoe-year-will-likely-peak-soon-but-adidas-has-plan 
Assume   the   firm   sells   the   base   model   of   Sambas   direct-to-consumers   (DTC)   from   their   online   store   at   a profit-maximising   price   of   $100 USD.   Assume   the   average   costs   of   production   is   $60 USD   per   shoe.   This figure   includes   the   costs   of   materials   (e.g. soles, synthetic   leather,   threads, logos/inks,   trims   etc.),
labour, shipping, insurance, marketing, and   other   expenses/overheads. Demonstrate   and   explain   what the   profit   of   this   firm   might   look   like   using   a key economics diagram, as   discussed   in   the   economics          lectures/videos   and   tutorials   in   BLAW1002 S2 2024. In   your   answer:
a.            For   the incremental quantities of monthly shoe production on   the x-axis, use hypothetical   values (rough guesses   from   your imagination). Use intuition   for making up   the incremental prices/costs on   they-axis.
b.       You   will   hand   draw   the   diagram, including   the   one   (1) isoprofit curve. Be   accurate   when   you   draw
your   isoprofit   curve.   To   show   to   the   reader   that   your   profit   is   the   same   (‘iso’), calculate   and   show   your workings   of   what   the   (same) iso-profit   would   be   for   the   price   of   $200 and   for   $80.
c.       At the   profit-maximising   price, identify   the   areas   of   producer   and   consumer surplus, and   calculate the price markup.
d.         Finally, analyse   and   compare   the   profit   and   price   markup   if   Adidas discounted the price of   shoes   by 30% for   the   month   of   September.500 ± 100 or so   words should be sufficient
Q3 – 5 Marks 
‘It   is   possible   in   future   for   Nike   to   be   swept   away   by   the   forces   of creative destruction’   . Critical   evaluate this   statement   and   elaborate   on   why   Nike   has   had   its   profits   eaten   away   by   2024 based   on   the   (freely-available) articles   below:
